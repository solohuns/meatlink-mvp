# MeatLink (MVP)

A simple front-end only prototype that connects Eastern Cape meat suppliers with Western Cape buyers. 
It shows available stock, simulates escrow-style payments, and books cold-storage transport â€” all in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Run locally (VS Code)
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Use the Live Server extension (recommended) or open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Data is stored in `localStorage` so it persists across refreshes.

## Structure
```
/index.html
/assets/css/styles.css
/assets/js/app.js
/assets/img/ (placeholder)
```

## Theme
White base with green (`#2fa36b`) and orange (`#ff8a00`) accents.

## Notes
- This is an MVP. Replace auth, payments, and transport integrations with real services before production.
- All forms have basic validation and demo flows to illustrate the experience.
